# 👋 Hi there, I’m Selalelo Moakamelo!

I’m a Data Engineer passionate about designing modern data solutions that turn raw data into valuable business insights. This **SQL Data Warehouse Project** demonstrates my ability to build an end-to-end data warehouse following best practices — from ingesting and cleansing data, to modeling a star-schema, and preparing data for analytics.

### [Weather Data Analytics Pipeline](https://github.com/Selalelo/AUTOMATED_DATA_PIPELINE)

In this real-time data analytics project, I:

- Developed a modular **data pipeline** to fetch data from a live api, store, transform, and visualize live weather data.
- Designed a **layered PostgreSQL schema** (`dev`) including staging, dimensional, and aggregated models.
- Used **Streamlit** and **Plotly** to build a live, interactive dashboard with daily and hourly weather trends.
- Built **dbt models** for data transformation, including staging, fact, and dimension tables.
- Secured database connections using **Streamlit secrets management** (`.streamlit/secrets.toml`) and disabled override controls in production.
- Set up **GitHub Actions** for CI to automate dbt runs, data ingestion, and dashboard updates.
- Followed and documented **strict naming conventions** and created a **data catalogue** to ensure clarity, scalability, and maintainability.
